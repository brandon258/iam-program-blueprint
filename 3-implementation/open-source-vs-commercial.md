# Choosing Between Open Source and Commercial IAM

## Open Source (e.g. Keycloak)

Pros:

- Highly customizable
- Fine-grained control over realms, flows, and themes
- No licensing cost

Cons:

- Requires infrastructure to manage
- UI-first workflows make CI/CD challenging without extensions
- Limited support for SCIM and governance out-of-the-box

## Commercial (e.g. Auth0, Okta, Entra ID)

Pros:

- Polished UI and documentation
- Built-in CIAM/IGA support (organizations, SCIM, audit logs)
- Easy integration with SaaS tools

Cons:

- High cost at scale
- Vendor lock-in
- Less flexible for edge cases

## What I Recommend

Use commercial solutions when speed, SaaS integrations, or regulatory audits are high priorities.  
Use open-source platforms when customization, infrastructure control, or cost are more important.
