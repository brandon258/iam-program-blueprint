# IAM Program Blueprint

## Overview

This repository provides a strategic and technical blueprint for building an Identity & Access Management (IAM) program from scratch in a modern enterprise environment.

While I have not yet led a greenfield IAM initiative professionally, this project showcases how I would approach the challenge—both at a high level and with tangible artifacts, templates, and working code. It is intended to demonstrate readiness for roles that require end-to-end IAM leadership.
