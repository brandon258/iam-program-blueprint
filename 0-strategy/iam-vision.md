# IAM Vision Statement

The goal of this IAM program is to deliver secure, scalable, and automated identity services that enable productivity while reducing risk. The program prioritizes:

- Secure-by-default architecture
- Developer self-service through automation
- Least-privilege access enforcement
- Regulatory compliance (e.g., SOC2, HIPAA, ISO)
- High availability and auditability across environments
