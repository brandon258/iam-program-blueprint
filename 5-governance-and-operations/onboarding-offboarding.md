# Onboarding & Offboarding

## Onboarding Flow

- Triggered by HRIS (e.g., BambooHR)
- Automatically provisions required accounts via SCIM/API
- Default access tied to department/role

## Offboarding Flow

- HRIS termination triggers deprovisioning
- Revokes sessions, access, MFA devices
- Sends notification to IT/Security
